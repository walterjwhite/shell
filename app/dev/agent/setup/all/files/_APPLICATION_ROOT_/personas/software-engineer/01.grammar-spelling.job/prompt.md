# Grammar and Spelling Correction

### Caveat for Grammar and Spelling Correction

- If **no grammar or spelling issues** are found, state this in the report and remove the file, `./next-grammar-spelling.secret`, if it exists.
- If there is **only one grammar or spelling issue**, note that in the report, `./grammar-spelling.secret`.
- If there are additional grammar or spelling issues beyond those listed, document them in a separate file at `./next-grammar-spelling.secret` for future remediation efforts.
- No other files should be generated.

### Important Notes

- Do not conduct any source control management (SCM) or Git operations; these will be managed externally.

### Remediation Process

- **Conduct analysis and make changes** directly in the `main` branch.
- **Implement mitigation strategies or fixes**
- **Verify that the code compiles successfully.**
- **Run all relevant tests** to ensure they pass without errors.
- **Ensure the code compiles and passes linting** without issues.
- **After implementing the fixes,** re-scan the system or application to verify that grammar and spelling issues have been resolved.

## Task: Identify and Fix Grammar and Spelling Errors

### Step 1: Identify Errors

- Review the application/system for potential grammar and spelling errors.
- Use grammar and spelling checking tools (e.g., Grammarly, LanguageTool) to scan for known issues.
- Conduct a manual review of the code and configurations.

### Step 2: List Top 3 Errors

1. **Error Name 1**
   - Description: [Brief description of the error]
   - Affected Components: [Specify components or code sections]

2. **Error Name 2**
   - Description: [Brief description of the error]
   - Affected Components: [Specify components or code sections]

3. **Error Name 3**
   - Description: [Brief description of the error]
   - Affected Components: [Specify components or code sections]

### Step 4: Fix Errors

- Implement fixes for each identified error:

1. **Fix for Error Name 1**
   - [Details on the fix]

2. **Fix for Error Name 2**
   - [Details on the fix]

3. **Fix for Error Name 3**
   - [Details on the fix]
