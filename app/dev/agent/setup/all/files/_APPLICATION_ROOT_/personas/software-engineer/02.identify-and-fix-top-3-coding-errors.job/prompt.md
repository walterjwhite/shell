## Coding Error Remediation Workflow

### Caveat for Coding Errors

- If **no coding errors** are found, document this in the report and remove the file, `./next-coding-errors.secret`, if it exists.
- If there is **only one coding error**, note that in the report, `./coding-errors.secret`.
- If there are additional coding errors beyond those listed, save them in a separate file at `./next-coding-errors.secret` for future remediation efforts.
- No other files should be generated.

### Important Notes

- Do not conduct any source control management (SCM) or Git operations; these will be managed externally.
- **After implementing the fixes,** re-scan the application or system to verify that tight coupling issues have been addressed.

### Remediation Process

- **Conduct analysis and make changes** directly in the `main` branch.
- **Implement mitigation strategies or fixes**
- **Verify that the code compiles successfully.**
- **Run all relevant tests** to ensure they pass without errors.
- **Ensure the code compiles and passes linting** without issues.
- **After implementing the fixes,** re-scan the system or application to verify that vulnerabilities have been resolved.

### Task: Identify and Fix Top 3 Coding Errors

### Step 1: Perform Analysis

- **Conduct an analysis** on the `main` branch to identify coding errors.
- **Utilize static code analysis tools** (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python) along with manual code reviews to pinpoint issues.

### Step 2: List Top 3 Coding Errors

For each coding error, provide the following details:

1. **Error Name 1**
   - **Description:** [Brief description of the error]
   - **Severity Level:** [Low/Medium/High]
   - **Affected Components:** [Specify components or code sections]

2. **Error Name 2**
   - **Description:** [Brief description of the error]
   - **Severity Level:** [Low/Medium/High]
   - **Affected Components:** [Specify components or code sections]

3. **Error Name 3**
   - **Description:** [Brief description of the error]
   - **Severity Level:** [Low/Medium/High]
   - **Affected Components:** [Specify components or code sections]
