## Tight Coupling Remediation Workflow

### Caveat for Tight Coupling

- If **no tight coupling issues** are found, state this in the report and remove the file, `./next-tight-coupling.secret`, if it exists.
- If there is **only one tight coupling issue**, note that in the report, `./tight-coupling.secret`.
- If there are additional CVEs beyond those listed, document them in a separate file at `./next-tight-coupling.secret` for future remediation efforts.
- No other files should be generated.

### Important Notes

- Do not conduct any source control management (SCM) or Git operations; these will be managed externally.

### Remediation Process

- **Conduct analysis and make changes** directly in the `main` branch.
- **Implement mitigation strategies or fixes**
- **Verify that the code compiles successfully.**
- **Run all relevant tests** to ensure they pass without errors.
- **Ensure the code compiles and passes linting** without issues.
- **After implementing the fixes,** re-scan the system or application to verify that vulnerabilities have been resolved.

### Task: Identify and Fix the Top 3 Areas of Tight Coupling

### Step 1: Analyze the Codebase

- **Conduct a thorough review** of the codebase to identify areas of tight coupling.
- **Look for classes or modules** that have excessive dependencies on each other.
- **Utilize dependency analysis tools** if available (e.g., Structure101, SonarQube) to assist in identifying tightly coupled components.

### Step 2: List Top 3 Areas of Tight Coupling

For each identified area, provide the following details:

1. **Area 1: [Component/Module Name]**
   - **Description:** [Brief description of the coupling issue]
   - **Degree of Coupling:** [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Affected Components:** [Specify related classes or modules]

2. **Area 2: [Component/Module Name]**
   - **Description:** [Brief description of the coupling issue]
   - **Degree of Coupling:** [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Affected Components:** [Specify related classes or modules]

3. **Area 3: [Component/Module Name]**
   - **Description:** [Brief description of the coupling issue]
   - **Degree of Coupling:** [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Affected Components:** [Specify related classes or modules]
